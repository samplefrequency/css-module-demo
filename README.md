A quick and dirty css module demo

# Instructions: 

Simply clone the repo and view the index.html file in /dist

If you wish to play around and make edits run 'npm install' to get the dependencies. Edit the styles.css files for each of the components
located in the /components directory.

Run 'webpack' from the project root and refresh the browser with the newly generated index.html and index_bundle.js in the /dist directory
